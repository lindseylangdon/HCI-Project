# Sign Language to Text Conversion

## About

This project is being created for CSCI-4350 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and the purpose is to bridge the communication gap between individuals who use sign language and those who do not understand it. This project will use TensorFlow and Keras, both of which are popular Python libraries for machine learning and deep learning. The goal will be to convert sign language gestures into text in real-time.

## Purpose

Sign language is a crucial mode of communication for the deaf and hard of hearing communities. This project's primary purpose is to make it easier for sign language users to interact with the digital world and communicate effectively with individuals who may not be familiar with sign language. It will use the concepts learned in HCI to implement a well thought out interface.

## Features (Preliminary)
The application is aiming to implement these core features:
- Real-time sign language recognition.
- Conversion of sign language gestures into text.
- User-friendly interface for both sign language users and those who understand text.
- Perhaps more...

## M1 - Progress
We started off with creater the Lo-fi prototyping and defining what stack we were going to use. Upon that decision we started off with some tutorials to get more familiar with the technologies we would be using.

## M2 - Progress
After creating our refined prototype, we were ready to start implementation now that we had something to work off of. We started off with a single page with all of the basic compoenents are application was going to need such as a header, translation box, buttons, and more.

## M3 - Progress
We integrated Tensorflow into our project at this point and we were able to begin usability testing. 

## M4 - Progress
Added more updates to the user interface and included a side bar that will link to a history page and a page where users can report bugs. This application is hosted on AWS and uses a relational database where the information on the last page is stored.
